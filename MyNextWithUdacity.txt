I plan to pursue 'Data Analyst Foundation Nanodegree' program from Udacity after completing 'Python Foundation Nanodegree' program. It involves mastering data fundamentals applicable to any industry, and learn to make data-driven decisions. Learn Excel and SQL, and gain data visualization skills with Tableau.
